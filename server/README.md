# Server for handling shelter donation management

## Requirements:

- go: https://go.dev/doc/install or `brew install go` if you have `brew` installed.

For reference, I am using `go` version `go1.20.6 linux/amd64`

## How to run:

From the `openapi-seattle-example/server` directory, run:

```
go run cmd/main.go
```

which should also download any missing dependencies.

Then we can curl things like:

```

```

## Utilities:

We use [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) for quick access to some scripts.

We also use [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/) for linting.
